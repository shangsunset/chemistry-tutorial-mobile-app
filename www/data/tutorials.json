The notion of matter and electric charge were understood but the actual components of the current were an anathema. First among many experiments are the Cathode Ray Tube Experiments. These cathode rays originate at a negative cathode and proceed towards a positive cathode. However, once the scientists introduced a magnet to the setting, they noticed these rays did not travel in straight lines. Rather, the rays were attracted towards the positive magnet, making them appear bent. Scientists understood that opposites attract and the current, which bent toward the positive end, must be composed of negatively charged \"things\" (we later call them electrons).\r\n",

        "instruction": "Electrons play a crucial role in chemical reactions and how compounds interact with each other. Remember, electrons are the negative particles in an atom that \"orbit\" the nucleus. Although we say they orbit the nucleus, we now know that they are actually in a random state of motion surrounding the nucleus rather than making circles around it, which is what an orbit implies. The best analogy to describe electron motion within an atom is how bees buzz around a beehive. They do no fly in complete circles around it, but they do hover and move around it in a seemingly random motion.\nElectrons increase in elements as protons do, which is from left to right and from top to bottom on the periodic table. Therefore, the element with the fewest electrons would be in the top left-hand corner of the table and the element with the most electrons would be in the bottom right hand corner. The elements are arranged so that the increase from element to element is one electron. Therefore, in the first row, we see hydrogen and helium. This is because hydrogen has one electron and helium has two electrons, so we place them in ascending order.",

We sit down, and our server hands us our menus and they take our order. They bring us our food and then give us the bill. Pretty much all our interactions in restaurants are with our servers.",
